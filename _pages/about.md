I am a passionate full stack developer from South Africa. As a current .NET Developer, I am very passionate about .NET and I want to continue exploring the .NET stack. This includes using more of .NET Core and even .NET 5+ while continuing to do full stack development. As an automation enthusiast, I love to incorporate this in any way or form. This includes setting up the CI/CD for automated deployments then using Selenium or TestCafe for frontend testing, adding unit tests and adding integration tests for API testing. Since I have a bit of a perfectionist personality, I tend to bring this into my work. Therefore, I would meticulously go over my work to ensure the quality is up to standard and that my development is bug-free.
